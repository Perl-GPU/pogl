+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                  OpenGL-0.6702
+------------------------------------------------------------------------+

General Notes:

 * This release fixes some minor build issures for Strawberry Perl 32bit
   where the wrong FreeGLUT library would be linked in---this failed at
   runtime during the 'perl Makefile.PL' step.

Highlights:

  * Clean up INSTALL, README, and bring more up-to-date.

  * Put util/strawberry.bat under git configuration management.

  * glutCloseFunc() feature has been disabled.  A warning is given
    the first time the close handler is called.

  * Strawberry perl builds are now detected and the build configuration
    is corrected.  This should allow for automated builds.



+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                  OpenGL-0.6701
+------------------------------------------------------------------------+

General Notes:

 * This is a work-around release to work around a problem with
   segfaults during the glutCloseFunc() processing.  Until a
   real fix is found, the feature has been disabled.

Highlights:

  * glutCloseFunc() feature has been disabled.  A warning is given
    the first time the close handler is called.

  * Strawberry perl builds are now detected and the build configuration
    is corrected.  This should allow for automated builds.



+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                  OpenGL-0.67
+------------------------------------------------------------------------+

General Notes:

 * This is a quick bugfix release to work around a build
   problem for Debian sid on AMD platforms.

Highlights:

  * Comment out failing tests in t/10_opengl_array.t.  Ideally,
    we could replace this implementation with something using
    pdls instead.

  * Some GLUT cleanup for POGL

  * Remove GL_TYPE_RGBA_FLOAT_ATI support.  The sid debian build
    for AMD has problems with this.

  * New example/glxgears.pl ported by Brian Medley (thanks!)

  * Removed OS/2 support code (no longer supported)

  * Various other fixes (see GIT_CHANGES)



+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                  OpenGL-0.66
+------------------------------------------------------------------------+

General Notes:

 * This test adds skips for some tests from OpenGL::RPN
   under current development avoiding FAILs in automated
   builds due to known problems.

 * It is compatible with the Prima GUI toolkit and the
   Prima::OpenGL module.



+------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                  OpenGL-0.65
+------------------------------------------------------------------------+

General Notes:

 * This is a point release for the Perl OpenGL module (POGL)
   with new features, bugs fixed and improved documentation.
 
 * OS/2 is no longer supported by POGL directly.


Highlights:

  * Paul Seamons contributed full tessellation support,
    documentation for OpenGL::Tessellation, and a *major* set
    of fixes and POD for the existing OpenGL::Array module.

  * The cygwin build of POGL now supports either the native
    win32 platform drivers or the X11/GLX bindings (default).
    Use interface=w32api or interface=wgl as args to the
    perl Makefile.PL to select.  NOTE: you have to pick one
    or the other.  If you change, any dependencies such as
    PDL::Graphics::TriD will need to be recompiled.

  * The included FreeGLUT DLL has been upgraded to 2.6.0
    thanks to Rob/sisyphus.

  * Prima::OpenGL has been released by Dmitry Karasik which
    adds support for Perl OpenGL to his cross-platform GUI
    toolkit in addition to bug fixes and code cleanup.
    Thanks, Dmitry!  See http://search.cpan.org/~karasik/Prima-1.30/
    for details.

|                  OpenGL-0.64_004
+------------------------------------------------------------------------+

General Notes:

 * This is a CPAN developers release for the OpenGL module.

   - It is a snapshot of the current git development tree
     and everything may not work correctly or have complete
     documentation.

     see the git log for full details.

   - All tests may not pass, especially ones corresponding
     to issues in KNOWN_PROBLEMS.

   - Manual build/install is recommended although the
     cpan shell may be used by specifying the distribution
     path rather than just the module name, e.g.:

     cpan> get  CHM/OpenGL-0.64_004.tar.gz
     cpan> make CHM/OpenGL-0.64_004.tar.gz
     cpan> test CHM/OpenGL-0.64_004.tar.gz
     cpan> look CHM/OpenGL-0.64_004.tar.gz

  * Fixed build for AGL to only use AGL, not X11 on Mac OS X.

  * Fixed _have_freeglut() checks in test.pl and elsewhere.

  * Fix glut_const.h typos that broke some GLUT macros.  Exiting
    the FreeGLUT event loop should work.

  Please see the GIT_CHANGES file for more details.  Thanks.

|                      OpenGL-0.61 Release Notes                         |
+------------------------------------------------------------------------+

  * FreeGLUT detection has been improved when both glut.h and freeglut.h
    are present on a system.

  * Fixed include path problems for glversion on Mac OS X.

  * Now builds out of the box on many linux, PC, and Mac OS X systems
    as a result of the move to FreeGLUT/GLUT for GUI operations.

  * This is the base release for the upcoming PDL-2.4.5 release with
    refactored 3D graphics using the Perl OpenGL module.

  * Improved Mac OS X build support, especially with GLUT (not FreeGLUT)
    and no X11 installed or server running.
    
  * Improved FreeGLUT binding and support for FreeGLUT vs GLUT.
    A number of bugs stomped.
    
  * Improved linux/GLX+X11 build support control although FreeGLUT or
    GLUT(on Mac OS X) is preferred for full functionality.
    
  * Fixed MinGW detection logic for ActivePerl configurations
    
  * Code clean up and bugs fixed.  Many were discovered as a result of
    the reconcilliation with PDL::Graphics::OpenGL requirements.
    
  * A few glp*() functions from PDL were added to POGL and confirmed
    consistent API with PDL::Graphics::OpenGL
    
  * glpcOpenWindow() is deprecated as an external, user visible function.
    The use of glpOpenWindow() is recommended.  It provides the exact
    same set of options and control.
    
  * Various documentation updates.
    
  * The test.pl demo program now works more robustly.

  * The mysterious freeglut font ... not found bug has been fixed!
